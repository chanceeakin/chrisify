# Roadmap

This is a list of all of the functionality areas within OpenCV, and OpenCV Contrib.

Any section listed with an "X" means that all of the relevant OpenCV functionality has been wrapped for use within GoCV.

Any section listed with **WORK STARTED** indicates that some work has been done, but not all functionality in that module has been completed. 

And any section that is simply listed, indicates that so far, no work has been done on that module.

Your pull requests will be greatly appreciated!
